# Thesis
As glacies melt and permafrost thaws microorganisms large amounts of dormant microbes are being released into the envirionment. This raises several questions like; what kind of microbes are being released? Are any of them potentially harmful? Does any of them carry genes of a special concern, like novel antimicrobial resistance genes?

During this thesis I investigated the microbial communties of kitchen middens at severel different archeological sites found in Greenland. Here permafrost is receding and we see and increased microbial activity. There is a real concern that through erosion and meltwater runoff microbes from the midden deposits can end up in the fjordsystems that today are important commersial fishing areas.

This repositories holds the code I created during this project. It mainly consists of bashs scripts to run tools on a HPC cluster and R scripts for data analysis and visulization.
